          <strong>Tyrannosaurus (/tɪˌrænəˈsɔːrəs, taɪ-/)</strong> is a genus of
          large theropod dinosaur. The type species
          <strong>Tyrannosaurus rex</strong> (rex meaning 'king' in Latin),
          often shortened to T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best
          represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North
          America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
          Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.
          Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the latest
          Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of the late Cretaceous period, 73.2 to 66
          million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids
          and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the
          Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.,

          Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with
          a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large
          and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but
          unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The
          most complete specimen measures 12.3–12.4 m (40–41 ft) in length, but
          according to most modern estimates, Tyrannosaurus could have exceeded
          sizes of 13 m (43 ft) in length, 3.7–4 m (12–13 ft) in hip height, and
          8.8 t (8.7 long tons; 9.7 short tons) in mass. Although some other
          theropods might have rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus in size, it is
          still among the largest known land predators, with its estimated bite
          force being the largest among all terrestrial animals. By far the
          largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most
          likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored
          herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods.
          Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger.
          The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure
          scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most
          paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active
          predator and a scavenger. <br />

          Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include some that are nearly complete
          skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one
          of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed
          significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its
          life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and
          potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its
          taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider
          Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a third Tyrannosaurus species,
          while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other
          genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized
          with Tyrannosaurus. At present, two species of Tyrannosaurus are
          considered valid; the type species, T. rex, and the earlier and more
          recently discovered T. mcraeensis. <br />

          As the archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the
          best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century and has been
          featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.
